# Chapi
Chapi is an extremely easy to use proxy to aid make those http requests you can't directly run on your application.
It is a standalone application compiled into a single binary, Can be self hosted or use mine at [chapihq.com](https://chapihq.com)


### Motivation (Reasons to use)
Numerous times i've wanted to use an API that required a private key to be part of the request somehow, in the header, url, or request body.

These private keys are not hidden and can be easily found on your frontend Application and used for malicious purposes.

This may remind you of writing a firebase function and there are similarites but with chapi you don't have to write code and it's all done with a GUI.
